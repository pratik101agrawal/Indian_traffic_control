 * @class MSVehicleTransfer
 * This object (each simulation owns exactly one) is responsible for the
 *  transfer of vehicles that got stocked within the network due to grid locks.
 *
 * The method addVeh is called by a lane if a vehicle stood to long at this
 *  lane's end. After being added to this transfer object and removed from the
 *  lane, it is moved over the consecutive edges. On each edge, it is tried to
 *  insert the vehicle again. The lanes are of course chosen by examining the
 *  vehicle's real route.
 *
 * This object is used as a singleton
