/**
 * @class MSDevice_Routing
 * @brief A device that performs vehicle rerouting based on current edge speeds
 *
 * The routing-device system consists of in-vehicle devices that perform a routing
 *  and a simulation-wide (static) methods for colecting edge weights.
 *
 * The edge weights container "myEdgeEfforts" is pre-initialised as soon as one
 *  device is built and is kept updated via an event that adapts it to the current
 *  mean speed on the simulated network's edges.
 *
 * A device is assigned to a vehicle using the common explicite/probability - procedure.
 *
 * A device computes a new route for a vehicle as soon as the vehicle is emitted
 *  (within "enterLaneAtEmit") - and, if the given period is larger than 0 - each
 *  x time steps where x is the period. This is triggered by an event that executes
 *  "wrappedRerouteCommandExecute".

     * When the first device is built, the static container of edge weights
     *  used for routing is initialised with the mean speed the edges allow.
     *  In addition, an event is generated which updates these weights is
     *  built and added to the list of events to execute at a simulation end.
