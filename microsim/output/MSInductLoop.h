 * @brief An unextended detector measuring at a fixed position on a fixed lane.
 *
 * Only vehicles that passed the entire detector are counted. We
 *  ignore vehicles that are emitted onto the detector and vehicles
 *  that change their lane while they are on the detector, because we
 *  cannot determine a meaningful enter/leave-times.
 *
 * This detector uses the MSMoveReminder mechanism, i.e. the vehicles
 *  call the detector if they pass it.
 *
 * Due to the inheritance from MSDetectorFileOutput this detector can
 *  print data to a file at fixed intervals via MSDetector2File.
